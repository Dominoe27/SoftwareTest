How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code is functional I’ll prioritize writing unit tests that cover both common use cases and edge cases. I’ll make sure to test individual methods for expected behavior, as well as error handling. Also, I’ll follow best practices for secure coding, like validating inputs, avoiding hardcoding sensitive data, and being mindful of exception handling to prevent unintended leaks. Regular code reviews and using tools like static analyzers and dependency checkers will help maintain functionality and security.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By carefully analyzing the given requirements and thinking about the end user’s perspective, what they are trying to accomplish, and what challenges they could potentially encounter. If something is unclear, I ask clarifying questions. Throughout the development process, I’ll stay focused on usability, ensure the program is intuitive and fulfills its intended purpose.

How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, first I break the problem down into smaller, manageable parts. Then I design classes and methods around clear responsibilities to keep the code organized. I think about how different components will interact and aim to reduce dependencies between them. Testing is part of the design process from the beginning; I plan how the software will be tested and build in validation at different layers to catch issues before deployment.
